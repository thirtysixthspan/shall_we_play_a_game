Wouldn't you prefer a good game of chess?

## The Game of Chess
First we'll need to review the [Rule of Chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess).

## Our choice of notation
We'll use [Descriptive Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_chess_notation)
for fun and because they use it in the chess game between HAL and Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
Descriptive Notation is an obsolete notation that uses a relative rather than absolute coordinate system 
whereby a position on the board is given by its rank, ranging from 1 to 8 starting on the moving player's 
side of the board, and its file, given by the name of the piece that occupies rank 1 at the start of the game.

## The cast of characters
King (K), Queen (Q), Rook (R), Bishop (B), Knight (N), and Pawn (P)
